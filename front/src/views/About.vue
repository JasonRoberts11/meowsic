    <h1>It's "About" Time</h1>
    <p>This website has a lot more for me to work on. Overall, I want to increase the functionality
    of the song editor, with a playlist at the bottom to play certain patterns. That would increase
    the amount of time the song could be, allow for different instruments, and allow for users of
    all kinds to make music faster and be more inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
    About the Instruments: I want to make it so that users can create their own custom instruments,
    Don't ask me how, but that is what I had planned. This project would take a lot longer for me to complete,
    but adding instruments would increase the functionality of this web-application. If users could make
    intricate instruments and could share them with others, then people could make all kinds of things.

    I want to add Profiles so people can view and even follow other people, and get notified of their songs.
    I want to add Comments so people can criticize and praise other people, and rate their songs.
    I want to add many many things, but we do not have all the time in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I intend on also adding a theme to cats because why not. It would make the website unique and fun.
      It is called <em>Meowsic</em> for a reason. This would be a fun project to work on in the summer, because alas,
      the COVID-19 Pandemic is really starting to hit hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used Vue.js, Node.js (or express or whatever), and MongoDb for this website.
      For the sound, I used the tone.js library. I am too lazy to add links to the previous text.
